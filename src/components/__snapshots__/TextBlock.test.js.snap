      PubMed Central (PMC) is a free digital repository that archives 
  publicly accessible full-text scholarly articles that have been published within the 
  biomedical and life sciences journal literature. As one of the major research 
  databases within the suite of resources that have been developed by the National 
  Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), PubMed Central is much more than just 
  a document repository. Launched in February 2000, the repository has grown rapidly 
  as the NIH Public Access Policy is designed to make all research funded by the 
  National Institutes of Health (NIH) freely accessible to anyone, and, in addition, 
  many publishers are working cooperatively with the NIH to provide free access to 
  their works.
