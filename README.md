## What is this app? 
This app was built as an interface for finding articles available
from PubMed Central Europe, and connecting with other researchers.<br>

It was initially built for experience with several technologies and 
frameworks, but always with the intention of making something 
genuinely useful for researchers. I will keep adding features as
time allows!<br>

## How was it built? 
This application was built using React.js, and many useful third party npm packages.
See package.json for these.<br>

The app uses a node.js server to store user / app information, which is hosted separately. This server is also a public repository of mine, 'pub-med-server'.
It uses mongoDB to store/update the information for user collections, threads, profiles, etc.

## What do you think?
I welcome feedback on this app! 

## Have an idea for the app? 
This is still a new project, but my hope is to have some collaborators sometime soon. I'm open to all new ideas for the project.

## Why PMC Europe?
I found PMC Europe's api more efficient / reliable to work with when developing this
app. I may add other api's in the future for more complete searches.

## CRA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
